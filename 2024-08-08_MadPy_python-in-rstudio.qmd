# Quick aside: RStudio

## Disclaimer

R is my preferred coding language.  All code in this talk, unless specified, is R code.

. . .

I use RStudio as my preferred IDE, and this talk was written from that perspective.

. . .

You can just as easily do this all in VSCode.  But please...

## Don't use Jupyter Notebooks. {.smaller}

- Hidden states hinder reproduciblity
  - Cells can be run in any order, any number of times.  According to one study[^1], [73% of all Jupyter notebooks are not reproducible with straightforward approaches.]{.class style="color:red"}
- Version control is nearly impossible because Jupyter notebooks are stored as single-line JSON files
  - Merging branches with `git` versioning nearly always breaks because `git` version control works on a line-by-line basis
  - Visualizing and understanding differences between versions is an impossible task
- No linting, no style help, no IDE integration
- Test-driven development is very difficult
- Jupyter notebooks don't scale well with big data

[^1]: https://lilicoding.github.io/papers/wang2020assessing.pdf

## RStudio is *objectively* the best IDE {.smaller}

-   easy GUI with console and terminal windows
-   easy, integrated package management (for R)
-   easy, integrated report/presentation generation via Rmarkdown or Quarto
-   `git` integration
-   easily view environment objects and run history
-   linting, syntax help, and tab-completion all built in
-   easily navigate and view files and set working directory
-   plot view and help windows

## "But why not just use VSCode?"

. . .

Because I don't want to.

![](assets/diva-girl.gif){fig-align="center"}

. . .

I like (and more importantly, ***know***) RStudio.

# Setup

## Python install and package management

. . .

There are utilities to install and manage Python packages and environments in RStudio[^4] but I don't use them.

[^4]: https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html

I use `mamba`[^2] instead.

[^2]: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

## Setting up RStudio to run Python

. . .

1.  Tell RStudio where you installed Python

. . .

Go to **Tools -\> Global Options**

## Setting up RStudio to run Python

![Enter the path to the python interpreter in your **base** environment](assets/rstudio_python_globalopts.png)

## Setting up RStudio to run Python

2.  Install the **reticulate** package

``` r
install.packages("reticulate")
```

. . .

**reticulate**[^5] is a Tidyverse package containing tools for interoperability between Python and R.

# **reticulate**

## What does **reticulate** do?[^6]

[^6]: https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html

. . .

1.  Allows calling Python ***from R*** in multiple ways including from RMarkdown/Quarto, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session

. . .

2.  Translates between R and Python objects (e.g., between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays)

. . .

3.  Provides flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments

## A note from Posit about the philosophy behind Python tools in Rstudio

> These tools are not intended for standalone Python work but rather explicitly aimed at the *integration of Python into R projects* (and as such are closely tied to the reticulate package).

They "strongly suggest" using one of the IDEs available for doing data science in Python for Python-only projects.[^7]

## What does **reticulate** do?

::: {.class style="color:grey"}

2.  Translates between R and Python objects (e.g., between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays)
:::

3.  Provides flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments

## Set your environment

First thing you *always* want to do is set your environment:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("iffrug")
```

. . .

Do this whether you're working interactively, calling scripts, or authoring reports.

. . .

There is also `use_python()` that allows you to specify an alternative version of python other than the one you set in your global options, or `use_virtualenv()` to set a virtual environment instead of a conda environment.

:::

## The `py` object

When you call `library(reticulate)`, it creates the `py` object in the **reticulate** package environment.

. . .

It is the bridge between R and Python, through which you can run Python code and interact with Python objects.

. . .

The most common way you will interact with it is to access any Python object from the R environment using the `$` operator, e.g., `py$x`.

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
*Always* call `library(reticulate)` or you won't be able to access the `py` object!
:::

## Importing modules

`reticulate::import()` can be used to import any installed Python module into your R environment.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

os <- import("os")
```

. . .

Then you can call any function from that module in R using `$`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

os$listdir(".") |> head()
```

. . .

If you'd like to access built in Python functions, use `import_builtins()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

builtins <- import_builtins()
builtins$print('Hello, World!')
```

## Sourcing scripts

Let's say I have a Python script that defines a function:

```python
## this is Python code

def add(x,y):
  return x + y
```

If I'd like to use that function in R, I can source it using `source_python()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

source_python('add.py')
add(5,10)
```

## Executing code

Let's say my collaborator wrote a Python script for processing some raw data.  I'd like to work with the processed data in R, but my collaborator only provided me with the raw data and the script.

. . .

I know the script requires a variable `file` that is a character string pointing to the path of the raw data.

---

I can use `py_run_string()` and `py_run_file()` to process the data, and then access any objects created into the Python main module using the `py` object exported by **reticulate**:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# Set the Python variable pointing to the raw data file
py_run_string("file = 'extdata/rawdata.csv'")

# run the processing script, which takes the file argument
py_run_file("process_raw_data.py")

# access the resulting df
py$df
```

## Working in RMarkdown^[https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html]

**reticulate** includes a Python engine for RMarkdown, and **knitr** v 1.18 and higher uses this engine by default.

. . .

Set your environment in your setup chunk:

![](assets/rmarkdown_setupchunk_reticulate.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-important}
*Always* call `library(reticulate)` or you won't be able to access the `py` object!
:::

---

Then you can start inserting Python chunks just like you would R chunks, and **knitr** will knit everything together:

![](assets/rmarkdown_pychunk.png){fig-align="center"}

---

Just like when working interactively, you can access objects created in Python chunks in R by using the `py` object:

![](assets/rmarkdown_py2r.png){fig-align="center"}

---

And you can access objects created in R chunks in Python by using the `r` object:

![](assets/rmarkdown_r2py.png){fig-align="center"}

## Working in Quarto

Quarto provides all the support for Python that RMarkdown does, plus support for Jupyter:

. . .

- Quarto supports rendering with the Jupyter kernel in addition to **knitr** and **reticulate** -- just put `jupyter: python3` in your YAML header and make sure the paths to Python and Jupyter are in your `PATH`.

---

- You can also provide a full `kernelspec` in your YAML:
```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
jupyter:
  kernelspec:
    name: xpython
    language: "python"
    display_name: "Python 3.7 (XPython)"
---
```

. . .

- Because it can use the Jupyter kernel, Quarto CLI can render Jupyter notebooks too:
```bash
quarto render document.ipynb
```
There is other support for Python from the Quarto CLI as well, plus a VSCode Quarto plugin.^[https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html]

# Type conversions

---

When calling into Python, R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent Python types.

. . .

When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R types.^[https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html#type-conversions]

. . .

The automatic conversion between R types and Python types works well in most cases, but sometimes you might want more control over the conversions.

## Conversion table

::: {.custom-small}

| R                      | Python            | Examples                                         |
|:-----------------------|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Single-element vector  | Scalar            | `1`, `1L`, `TRUE`, `"foo"`                       |
| Multi-element vector   | List              | `c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)`, `c(1L, 2L, 3L)`              |
| List of multiple types | Tuple             | `list(1L, TRUE, "foo")`                          |
| Named list             | Dict              | `list(a = 1L, b = 2.0)`, `dict(x = x_data)`      |
| Matrix/Array           | NumPy ndarray     | `matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)`         |
| Data Frame             | Pandas Dataframe  | `data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))` |
| Function               | Python function   | `function(x) x + 1`                              |
| Raw                    | Python bytearray  | `as.raw(c(1:10))`                                |
| NULL, TRUE, FALSE      | None, True, False | `NULL`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`                          |

:::

## Controling when conversion happens

If you'd like to work directly with Python objects by default you can pass `convert = FALSE` to the `import()` function.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# import numpy and specify no automatic Python to R conversion
np <- import("numpy", convert = FALSE)

# do some array manipulations with NumPy
a <- np$array(c(1:4))
(sum_np <- a$cumsum())

# what is sum?
class(sum_np)
```

---

Then when you're done working with the object in Python, you can convert it to an R object explicitly with `py_to_r()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# convert to R explicitly at the end and print object
(sum_r <- py_to_r(sum_np))

# what is sum_r?
class(sum_r)
```

::: {.callout-note}

We'll be using both the `sum_np` and `sum_r` objects in examples later on, so take note of their difference

:::

## Defining the conversion

Numeric types are different between R and Python.  For example, `42` in R is a float, while in Python it's an integer.

If you want to explicitly define a number as an integer in R so that it's passed as such to Python, use the `L` suffix:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

class(42)
class(42L)
```

---

If a Python API requires a list but you're only passing it a single element, you can wrap it in base `list()`:

```r
foo$bar(indexes = list(42L))
```

. . .

Similarly, if the Python API wants a `tuple`, you can use `reticulate::tuple()`:

```r
tuple("a", "b", "c")
```

. . .

And if the Python API wants a dictionary, you can use `reticulate::dict()`:

```r
dict(foo = "bar", index = 42L)
```

## Indices

Python uses 0-based indices for collections:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

sum_np[0L]
```

while R uses 1-based indices:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

sum_r[1]
```

::: {.callout-note}

Notice the need to explicitly use an integer when slicing the Python object

:::

---

Python indices are ***non***-inclusive for the end range, while R indices are:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

sum_np[2L:4L]
sum_r[2:4]
```

. . .

And negative indexing in Python counts from the ***end*** of the container, while in R it removes that index:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

sum_np[-1L]
sum_r[-1]
```

# Arrays

## The TL;DR^[https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/arrays.html]

R and Python represent arrays and matrices in memory differently:

- R only supports column-major order (FORTRAN-style)
- NumPy supports both column-major and row-major (C-style) order, but defaults to row-major

---

The most important thing to remember about this is that

**R and Python print arrays differently.**

. . .

These are the exact same array:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

(x <- np$arange(1, 9)$reshape(2L, 2L, 2L))
```

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

(y <- py_to_r(x))
```

:::
::::

## More array considerations

- Dense R arrays are presented to Python as column-major NumPy arrays (FORTRAN-style).
- *All* NumPy arrays (column-major, row-major, or otherwise) are presented to R as column-major arrays, since that's all R can understand.
- R arrays are only copied to Python when they need to be, otherwise data are shared.
- NumPy arrays are *always* copied when moved into R arrays.  This can sometimes lead to multiple copies of any one array in memory at one time.

---

Remember this 2x2x2 array?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

x
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

y
```

:::
::::

. . .

These are the exact same array, so why do they look different?

---

Python groups by the first index when printing, while R groups by the last index:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

x
x[0L,,]
x[,,0L]
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

y
y[1,,]
y[,,1]
```

:::
::::

## What about arrays from R to Python?

In the previous example I created an array in Python and ported it to R.  What about the other way around?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

(v <- array(1:24, c(4, 3, 2)))
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

(w <- np$array(v))
```

:::
::::

---

The NumPy array will be created using column-major ordering:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

w$flags
```

Remember:

- `F` for "FORTRAN" (column-major order)
- `C` for "C" (row-major order)

---

You can always create NumPy arrays in column-major order by passing the `"F"` flag:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

np$reshape(np$arange(1, 25), c(4L, 3L, 2L))
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

np$reshape(np$arange(1, 25), c(4L, 3L, 2L), "F")
```

:::
::::

. . .

You *can* rearrange R arrays into row-major order, but it's gross.

## Reshaping arrays

The R `dim()` function is used to reshape arrays in R.  This works by changing the `dim` attribute of the array, effectively re-interpreting the array indices using column-major semantics.

. . .

Remember though that NumPy uses row-major semantics by default; hence, its `reshape` method uses row-major semantics.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# NumPy reshape uses row-major semantics
np$reshape(np$arange(1,5), c(2L,2L))
```

So if you're mixing R and Python code, you may get inconsistent results.

---

To overcome this, use `reticulate::array_reshape()` to reshape R arrays using row-major semantics.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# make an array from a vector
# of 4 elements:
u <- 1:4

# dim() uses
# column-major semantics
dim(u) <- c(2,2)
u
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# array_reshape() uses
# row-major semantics
array_reshape(1:4, c(2,2))
```

## Sparse matrices

**reticulate** supports the conversion of sparse matrices created by the **Matrix** R package to and from SciPy CSC matrices.^[https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html#sparse-matrices]

. . .

I tried to make an example but working out the dependencies for `scipy.sparse` was way too much work.

. . .

<https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_dependencies.html> may have been helpful but I didn't care enough.

# Data Frames

## The important points

As mentioned earlier, R data frames can be automatically converted to and from Pandas data frames.  By default, columns are converted using the same rules governing R array <=> NumPy array conversion, with a couple extensions:

- R factors <=> Python categorical variables
- R POSIXt times <=> NumPy array with dtype=`datetime64[ns]`

## The important points

If the R data frame has row names, the generated Pandas data frame will be re-indexed using those row names, and vice versa.

. . .

If a Pandas data frame has a `DatetimeIndex`, it is converted to character vectors as R only supports character row names.

## Using Pandas nullable data types

Pandas out of the box handles `NA`s differently than R:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

(df <- data.frame(
  int = c(NA, 1:4),
  num = c(NA, rnorm(4)),
  lgl = c(NA, rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 2)),
  string = c(NA, letters[1:4])
))
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

r_to_py(df)
```

:::
::::

---

However, Pandas has experimental support for nullable data types (represented by `pd.NA`), but you have to enable it first:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: true

# tell Pandas to use NAs
options(reticulate.pandas_use_nullable_dtypes = TRUE)

r_to_py(df)
```

# Final Points

## For advanced Python users

For advanced Python users, there's more documentation on

- Contexts
- Iterators
- Functions
- Creating high-level R interfaces for Python libraries

## Access to Python help from R

You can print documentation on any Python object using `py_help()`:

```r
py_help(os$chdir)
```

This will open a text document outside of RStudio:

```
